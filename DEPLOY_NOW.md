## 🚄 Backend Deployment (Railway)

### 2. Deploy Backend to Railway
1. **Visit**: https://railway.app
2. **Sign up with GitHub** (if not already)
3. **New Project** → **Deploy from GitHub repo**
4. **Select Repository**: `restlesspilot/brillenzChess`
5. **Configure Service**:
   - Service Name: `brillenz-chess-backend`
   - Root Directory: `server`
   - Build Command: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - Start Command: `npm start`
6. **Add Database**:
   - Click "Add Service" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway automatically sets `DATABASE_URL`

### 3. Set Environment Variables in Railway
In Railway dashboard → your service → Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
JWT_SECRET=brillenz-chess-super-secret-jwt-key-2024
FRONTEND_URL=https://brillenz-chess.vercel.app
PORT=3001
```

### 4. Deploy Backend
Click "Deploy" - Railway will build and start your backend.

## 🔗 Connect Frontend to Backend

### 5. Update Vercel Environment Variables
Once your Railway backend is deployed:

1. **Get Railway URL**: Copy from Railway dashboard (e.g., `https://brillenz-chess-backend-production.up.railway.app`)
2. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** → Your Project → Settings → Environment Variables
3. **Add these variables**:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL=https://your-railway-url.railway.app
   ```
4. **Redeploy Frontend**: Go to Deployments → Click "..." → "Redeploy"

## 🗄️ Run Database Migrations

After backend deployment:
1. **Railway Dashboard** → Your service → Deploy logs
2. **Find the deployment** and check if migrations ran
3. **If needed**, you can run manually in Railway console:
   ```bash
   npm run db:migrate:deploy
   ```

## ✅ Test Your Live App

### 6. Verify Deployment
1. **Frontend**: https://brillenz-chess.vercel.app
2. **Backend Health**: https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/health
3. **Test Features**:
   - Local chess gameplay ✓
   - User registration ✓
   - Multiplayer features ✓
   - AI opponents ✓

## 🎯 Expected Live URLs

After deployment, you'll have:
- **Frontend**: `https://brillenz-chess.vercel.app`
- **Backend**: `https://brillenz-chess-backend-production-XXXX.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: `https://your-backend-url/api/health`

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version (should be 18+)
2. **CORS Errors**: Verify `FRONTEND_URL` in Railway env vars
3. **Database Issues**: Ensure PostgreSQL service is running in Railway
4. **WebSocket Issues**: Check `NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL` in Vercel

### Quick Fixes:
```bash
# Test backend health
curl https://your-railway-url.railway.app/api/health

# Should return:
# {"status":"OK","timestamp":"...","database":{"status":"healthy"}}
```
